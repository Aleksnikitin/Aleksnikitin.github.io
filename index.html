			<p>Domo is a Japanese character often pasted in to relevant or major scenes of disaster as the apparent cause
				for destruction. Domo's usage is very similar to the more contemporary Disaster Girl. He has grown to become
				a pop culture icon.</p>
			<p>According to his mythology[8], Domo was hatched from an egg and lives underground with a rabbit, Usajii. He
				loves watching television and is known for passing gas when he gets nervous. He also has a fear of apples,
				since his ancestors became extinct after eating them.[3] He doesn't speak, he only communicates via low
				noises that sound like his name.</p>
			<p>Since "domo" is also an initialism for the game Dream of Mirrors Online and a word in several other
				languages, it has been excluded from this graph. Search for Domo-kun and the Japanese translation both seem
				to correlate, although the search volume for both has decreased over the years.</p>
